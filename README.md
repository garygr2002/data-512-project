# New York City: Income and Race: A Study of Community Racial Balance & Average Income in NYC

## Final Project, DATA-512-A2, Gary Gregg, University of Washington, Autumn 2017

Goal: The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between community racial balance and average residential income in New York City.  We explore fractional relationships of population between pairs of three races: African American, Non-Hispanic Caucasian, and Latino.  Based on average earnings of residents in communities with populations such as these, we create linear models with low bias, examine the resulting slopes of the lines, their significance, and their meanings.
